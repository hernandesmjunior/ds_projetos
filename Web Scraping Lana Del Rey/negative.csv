119,Evanesims,"Mar 19, 2021",1,"<span>One of the most boring, pretentious albums I have ever heard. This is just bad...</span>",Negative
120,justicestan,"Mar 19, 2021",1,"<span>As a Lana del Ray fan, i am truly dissappointed by what i've heard. She continued to put out another album which sounds the same. Hopefully her next project will be more inspired. I can't believe it has come to this.</span>",Negative
121,acecyan,"Mar 19, 2021",0,"<span>This def takes a few listens, especially since the pop and hook-y elements from her previous projects are almost completely gone. But, when you do get the hang of the songs, you'll see the masterpiece that the album is outwards, and within</span>",Negative

132,Lizzz,"Mar 19, 2021",2,"<span>Didnt top NFR, Underperformed. I am afraid she will never top that album. Album sounds monotonous, Her vocals soud the same. Great writting but it was wasted in the production. Sounds basic, and doesnt show a growth as an artist.<br/>I do not recommend it.</span>",Negative

139,Alexsb,"Mar 19, 2021",0,"When we thought Lana Del Rey couldn't do a worse job than ""Norman F * cking Rockwell!"" she decides to release another album, an album full of basic lyrics like the ones she has written throughout her mediocre career, it is inevitable that Lana Del Rey will fail, she deserves her album to fail, Lana Del Rey He should leave the musical environment, it is certainly not his thing, he has shown us that he does not even know how to compose a decent lyrics, this new album is disgusting!.",Negative

151,hemildatheodore,"Mar 19, 2021",1,The mv and the main song chemtrails over the country club is the only good on the album. Remaining songs only contains same vocals and this album's cover and name proves that she's a racist and when pointed out she also mafe it clear on the Instagram.,Negative

224,All_ButTrU4,"Mar 20, 2021",0,Unfortunately this record has nothing interesting to actually give. It sounds like a to do list. It's experiments create botched Frankenstein's and the title song drones on. The skill which fortified the greatness of NFR! is discarded onto her lyrics. The production and vocal performance swan dive directly into safe. Lana del rey effectively is caught in a creative Bermuda triangle but unlike other similar wreckage she won't fade since her dedicated fan base will flood music stores and metacritic to try equate this  with quality,Negative
