53,gaveriel,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"Lana’s newest album that is concise in it’s sequencing, and diaristic in it’s writing. It’s also unafraid to look at the entirety of her life (up until this point), and write about it honestly. The content here is different in many ways, without sacrificing the subject matter she’s well-known for. More importantly, the perspective here is irrevocably altered. Lana’s sound here isn’t channeled or reflected by the waves on Venice Beach, or the hectic noise of a New York borough. Here, Lana’s poetry undulates over the Great Plains and America’s most famous national park. The record is informed by experiences stretching from Lana’s late teenaged years (when she first discovered her passion for music), to recent trips that have taken her to Oklahoma, Nebraska, and the like. These places and the freedom they offered from the grip of L.A.’s celebrity culture and it’s suffocating sunlight, are the inspirations behind Lana’s turn to more stripped-back, instrument-driven backing production. After several albums with lush, baroque Wall-of-Sound production, Lana seems to have lost her fascination with the associations such sound has with the circuses and decadence of Hollywood’s past. This seems to have inspired her return (partially) to the music that she made before her breakthrough. An eclectic, rock-ish band, clearly played live in studio, backs her voice on almost every track. The feedback frequently lingers for a few seconds after each song’s closings. Lana’s songwriting is still concerned with twisted love, being held captive by the fame machine that actively participated in the destruction of her idols, and her contemporaries. Her rumination isn’t limited to these ideas, as she sings about her connection to God, an insatiable hunger for experiencing new surroundings and people. She invites people to become part of her personal narrative on collaborative tracks, like the uncredited Nikki Lane on Breaking Up Slowly, and Zella Day with Weyes Blood on the ascendant Joni Mitchell cover, For Free. The perspective is entirely new on Chemtrails, even as she takes snippets of melody and lyrics from past work to rework and reinterpret in her present state of freedom. She delights in narrating this chapter of her life while acknowledging the darkness it took to get here in the first place. In fact, she respects and even gives thanks to the struggle, rather than pretend she’s too far past it to care. Ultimately, this record is about Lana returning to her roots after she accomplished everything she wanted as a young 20-something. Not to assure herself that it was all worth it, but to take the stories she doesn’t want to be left behind, and to bring them with her as she decides who to be. Without the exclusive Complex interviews, the award shows, or even the respect of the general public that characterized much of her interaction with the world up until a year ago. She celebrates her ability to escape the world that was on fire in NFR! , in the song Wild at Heart. The fire-and-brimstone of 2019 L.A. she wrote dirges about couldn’t my kill her. Wild at Heart samples the song How to disappear from her previous record, in which she relates her acceptance of the stifling setting of a city that was dying all around her. In Wild at Heart, the breakdown from How to disappear transforms the quiet Chemtrails track into a beautiful declaration of how she fled the paparazzi, the hell of endless summer, and the criticism of vicious strangers that could have very well been her end. She didn’t evaporate into the coastal heat at all. Lana chose to seek better pastures, and by extension, new inspiration for her art. If Chemtrails is the result, it was the best decision she’s ever made.",Positive
54,tulsalanafreak,"Mar 20, 2021",10,<span>Lana once again surprised me with her amazing songwriting skills and new sounds. The production on this album is very interesting in a good way. Lana deserves the world!</span>,Positive

57,HausOfBabylonia,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"Following the critically acclaimed NFR! with its roaring soundscapes and profound lyrics Chemtrails constitutes a new chapter in Lana Del Rey‘s catalog, setting the mood for her projects yet to come. She is ""Wild At Heart"" now and has left the tumultuous city L.A., and on her musical trip to the Midwest (noticeable by the enormous amount of acoustic guitar compared to prior albums) she gathers her closest family around herself. Escaping the West Coast, breaking up slowly with the woman that once drowned in the melancholy of Americana and hopeless romance she is on the move, and although she describes the album as a place of ""standing still"", songs like ""Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost“ remind us that she is on a mission: the muse of so many recent alternative songwriters is redefining and relocating herself musically as well as lyrically, but not without being reminiscent of her past self.Album opener ""White Dress"" may be THE highlight on the record and shows Del Rey vocally performing in a completely new way. Her voice close to breaking, she reincarnates the Lizzy Grant era: it seems that she is aware of the whole Del Rey timeline, who she was and who she is, but the question remains who she will be? We cannot guess at this point, but ""Dance Till We Die"" reminds us that we haven’t seen the last of her, and that Chemtrails is only the first chapter of a new era, a new departure on the way to her becoming a timeless classic and a junction of the culture.",Positive

108,viniciussawate,"Mar 19, 2021",9,"<span>The sound bet here is again on delicacy. The tracks have sparse accompaniment, with piano, pedal steel and guitars with clean timbres appearing in the foreground in songs that, almost entirely, give up percussion, the drums, when they appear, almost always mark only time, making that the central focus on the melodies, lyrics and voice of Lana that sounds better with each album.</span>",Positive

117,Alexsmile,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"<span>Lana is back and she's cooler than ever. While this album doesn't top NFR it's still very much up there with it as one of her best. The folky, witchy vibe and the vulnerability on these songs are STUNNING.</span>",Positive

170,venicechicken,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"An album with extremely incredible lyrics, Lana shows that she really is one of the greatest (if not the greatest) composer in the Americas. Chemtrails, a continuation of the acclaimed NFR!, shows that the singer has not lowered her level in composition and vocals, incredible vocals. Now a question: how will she sing the incredible and long vocals from 'Shades Of Cool' and the whispered and high-pitched vocals from 'White Dress'? To Justin's terrible fans; do not waste time giving low marks for this incredible album. That will not change Justice's lyric disaste... Favorites: Tulsa Jesus Freak, Dark But Just A Game, For Free and finally the most prominent, Breaking Up Slowly, incredible vocals by Nikkie Lane and Lana Del Rey, this duo has great harmony",Positive
172,Samarqand,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"A unique, raspy young singer from the beginning, whose voice belied the darkness and often controversial nature her lyrics & persona would take on. Regardless of your thoughts about the substance of her music, it is undeniable that she has become a better songwriter, singer and performer with each subsequent album. Masterpieces topped by masterpieces. Well, Norman F**king Rockwell is topped. Gorgeous, with slight changes in tone and speed expressing more than many artists do with lyrics for entire songs. Her voice can be so fragile, then so strong, then so biting... Always wistful, always haunted, always with an underlying sadness. You may not agree with her message, but she gives it a delivery not to be forgotten.",Positive
173,Yesmaffei,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"Mostrando estar cada dia mais confortável com a escrita e com sua própria persona lana traz mais um capítulo da sua própria história, que ela não permite ser escrita por ninguém (como ela sempre gosta de lembrar).Um trabalho completamente novo e descolado do antecessor, em que pese ter o mesmo produtor, o que evidência o poder de alcance da artista, que não precisa repetir fórmulas. Se permite experimentar e brinca com o folk em músicas como Not All Who Wander Are Lost, trazendo um novo elemento para a discografia.Em yosemite ela faz uma autoreferencia no instrumental, que trás um pequeno gosto do clássico Born to Die (million dollar Man) , além de ser uma óbvia continuação lírica à faixa Best American Record, amarrando pontas da história que vem criando.Em breaking up slowly a velha e conhecida Lana volta para falar sobre as dores de um coração partido, entretanto deixa evidente o quanto cresceu em suas técnicas vocais.Um álbum que completo e que não precisa disputar espaço com a antecessor.",Positive
174,NelsonB,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"<span>If you only have a habit of listening to pop and songs with lots of arrangements you will never get used to Lana's latest works.

188,vperezac,"Mar 19, 2021",9,"Chemtrails shows itself as a much more humble, carefree album than any of Lana's past works. It may not reach the ultimate high that NFR did, but it's a closer contender for the title of ""Lana's best album. She has found her sound, although this album tries to dip into Country/Folk aesthetics, it's done in such a suited way that it submerges the listener to watch her depiction of the Midwest in the Lana Del Rey style: Poetic, breezy, sometimes melodramatic and nostalgic.",Positive
189,Ieavegetout,"Mar 19, 2021",8,"Beautiful album. Her high head voice on White Dress is amazing. In fact, White Dress is one of the best songs on the record and possibly her best opening track.  The title track is another one of my favorites. I like the inclusion of AutoTune in the background of Tulsa Jesus Freak. The last 40 seconds of Wild At Heart, OMG!! That bass line on Breaking Up Slowly, loves it. Great album.",Positive

193,jamesblues,"Mar 19, 2021",10,<span>This is the natural follow-up to NFR!. She's back with a folkly sound that fits her perfectly. She never does the same thing twice and always comes back with something new. Very intriguing lyrics about fame and what her life was previously and what she wants it to be. Overall a perfect album from Miss Del Rey once again!.</span>,Positive
194,spacepro,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"Personally, I am delighted with this album. I don't understand those who say that the album is boring. The first 6 songs are listened to in one breath. (Absolutely all are beautiful, but wild at heart is something)  Not all who wander are lost and Yosemite just blows with happiness and harmony. I hope this is connected with her personal life) Well, the last 2 songs perfectly continue the dynamics of the album, especially the bridge in Dance till we die (there have not been such surprises since the days of Heroin). Just got a taste, as the album is already closed by the beautiful for free. In general, the album turned out to be very interesting, the main thing is holistic, surpassing even in this quality NFR! (mainly because of its length).In general, in my opinion, the album turned out to be excellent: for the first time, ideally holistic, laconic and at the same time atmospheric (ideal for evening trips by car), in many respects this is the merit of the instrumental, it is minimalistic, Jack did not overdo it and did nothing superfluous, but got bull's-eye. My favourites are all the songs, I want to listen to this album again and again.",Positive

200,Aldairxavier,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"O álbum é lindo e inovador, porém o NFR ainda consegue se sobressair e ser melhor. Pelo clipe de Chemtrails, eu pensei que Lana iria voltar com a vibe de Born to Die, mas ela diversificou e entregou hinos, como Dark but Just a Game, Dance Till We Die e WIld ar Heart. Eu amei, mas espero o retorno mais selvagem e impulsivo de Lana, sem deixar sua maturidade e sua grande evolução de composições, produções musicais e vocais.",Positive

The weather in this record is somewhat completely different from NFR yet it has some similarities.The music direction feels more effortless than her last albums but is more palatable this time around, I feel like this album will please the audiences more, just like Born To Die.For the first time, I actually feel Lana being more authentic to herself as a writer and a singer, I had this problem with her lyrics being always so plastic in a sense of reality, now I can feel she's letting go of that insane fantasy and being truthful to herself and to whoever she sings about.",Positive

Novamente, ela mostra o amor que tem pela sua ídola, Joni Mitchell, com um lindo cover de For Free (que conta com Weyes Blood e Zella Day). Enfim, um belo trabalho.",Positive

269,sergioyisus,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"Chemtrails Over The Country Club sigue el patrón usado en la producción de Norman **** Rockwell. En cada producción se ve el desapego de Lana por ir a lo comercial y es así como labra su camino a ser una de las mejores compositoras de nuestros tiempos, leyenda, icono y dejar un legado para las generaciones futuras. De por si, sentó las bases de lo que es la música pop al día de hoy, sin promoción alguna, su nombre tiene un gran peso.",Positive
270,N1e3nn5a7,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"Definitely going to be one of the biggest favorites this year. Lana as always shows her exceptional charm and in some way she even goes back to the basics with all the guitar sounds and singing about being a waitress. The instrumentals are crazy, someone may think they’re even too much, but I think it’s a perfect balance between her angelic voice, soft piano sounds and interesting guitar samples. Pretty sure not everyone is going to like it, but I enjoyed it, every single song of it.",Positive

When you look at the names of the songs and you already know that they’ll have a special place in your heart. And one day these songs will remind you of days when they came out...The album gives me that warm country/folk vibe. It’s like we’re sitting in the bar with old friends and Lana is singing just for us, just for her friends. And during this era we see so many people around her - family and friends (just look at the album cover)!!! So beautiful and cozy! And it makes me feel like I’m a part of it (and here you might think I’m crazy and yes I actually am haha). I feel the connection to Lana and her emotions and feeling. We’re closer than ever. I love every single song: Tulsa Jesus Freak - I’m in love with this song! White hot forever! It was supposed to be the name of this album if you remember it:) White dress - so nostalgic and beautiful(especially the vocal), I can’t wait to see the video. It’s going to be amazing! Wild at heart - it reminds me of Mariners Apartment Complex - magic! Not all who are wander are lost - wow it’s like something from Ultraviolence but with a flavour of COTCC. Yosemite - it’s like a movie soundtrack. Dance till we die !!! What? Have you heard that amazing bridge? Aaaahhh I’m so impressed by the Chemtrails and the lead song is fantastic so is the video, I can’t stop listening to it. Thank you, Lana, for everything you’ve done! I love you and your music, and your poetry so much.",Positive

The songs in the album sound even more mature, the lyricism reflects her growth, and how now everything is more suttle, less agitated, and agressive and it's not that it is not sad anymore, but it shows maturity. I really cannot say yet that it can be right next to Ultraviolence and NFR, but it sure is one of her best works. Thank you for your music, really. Best track, probably Dark But Just a Game, although the title track is one of the best of her career.",Positive

383,Archellarchell,"Mar 20, 2021",10,"The best one so far! Didn’t expect she’ll go full on folk-country style & it works perfectly for her voice to be honest. “White Dress” as an opening track is a good choice, when first time listening, it felt odd especially in the chorus part but as it goes I got familiar with it and love it ever since — Overall it talks about fame, on her teenage days, working hard then getting into the music scene which she reminisces and wanting to go back, even though it’s not my story to tell, it is nostalgic at last. The vocals on “Let Me Love You Like A Woman” & “Tulsa Jesus Freak” are beyond amazing! There are production where it kind of reminiscent with her previous works such as “Wild At Heart” & “Yosemite” but they are improved versions—much profound. Though NFR! is still the best, chemtrails is much more exceptional and more personal.",Positive

436,leminiscence,"Mar 19, 2021",8,"This album is one of Lana's best. It's certainly not as good as NFR, but it surprised me after listening to the singles. White Dress starts out the album very strong and provides a comfortable transition to the title track, I must say I'm not a fan of Tulsa Jesus Freak, but it works relatively well with the flow of the album, but is quite different from all the other songs. Let Me Love You Like a Woman finally sounds good, probably because of its newfound context. Wild at Heart uses instrumentals from songs on NFR, which seemed quite unusual and unnecessary, would've liked to see a continuation of the production of the first part of the song, instead of suddenly feeling like it transformed into How to Disappear, with a melody ripped out of hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have given me a very conflicted feeling, and the song is quite repetitive anyways and comes off as immature because of its way-too-common resolution in the chorus. With Dark But Just a Game, the record seems to turn around, the song itself was my favourite after my first listen through, but it is also quite repetitive a suffers from a cliché resolution in the chorus, just like Wild at Heart. The instrumentation on this song is also quite similar to NFR, but that is ok since the intro is quite unique. Not All Who Wander are Lost is a beautiful completely acoustic retreat, but it retains the same 2nd half feeling set by DBJAG, it's refrain sounds a bit too sharply syncopated for a song like this, but after a repeat listens, it makes more sense. Yosemite is slow, emotional, and brings back some of Lana's old subtle grandiosity which feels slightly out of place, but it works out fine. Breaking up slowly is a very interesting track, the vocals sound completely different from anything I've ever heard from Lana, but no additional artist is listed (at least on Spotify) it's startling when it first starts and seems quite a bit louder than the rest of the record; not much for dynamics. Dance Till We Die is a beautiful song, it amalgamates a melody I feel like I've heard quite a lot with Lana, and although the rhythm is repetitive, the production on this song is delicate and very fitting for the way a listener might be feeling emotionally at this point in the album. Lana's vocals could be slightly more coordinated on this song, however. Oh and the breakdown, the closest thing I've ever heard Lana sound to Fiona Apple, it was pretty surreal. She could've run with it more though, returning to the old style of the song felt slightly disappointing for some reason. Unfortunately my favourite song on the record, Lana's cover of Joni Mitchell's For Free mixes beautiful production with a perfect artist collaboration; ft. Zella Day, Weyes Blood. It is a perfect closer to this pretty solid record. Overall I think Lana did her thing again, she created some amazing songs and some songs that seem a bit out of place. Overall this is a very solid effort, and although it's certainly not one of her best records, it's intimate tone, touching writing, and relatively cohesive and quality production will earn it a spot in my usual rotation. I'd give it an 8.4 if I could, thank you Lana for another enjoyable piece of art :D",Positive

465,bernasmendes,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"<span>After the critically acclaimed NFR! the hype of this album was huge, and the expectations met the reality for sure. Magic happens when Lana and Jack work together, and no one can deny it. Chemtrails is so genuinely pure, so raw, so effortlessly beautiful and out of this world. I'm out of words. I'm just glad I live in the same era as Lana del Rey.</span>",Positive

469,hgerik,"Mar 20, 2021",8,"With ""Chemtrails Over The Country Club"" Lana proves again that she can compete with other recent artists due to her excellent songwriting skills. Throughout the Album you can hear songs from different genres, with different styles, while you may not like a few of them, you for sure will love other songs to heaven. Since some songs like ""White Dress"" are to experimental for MY taste I need to take some points there.But no matter a contender for Album of the Year at the next Grammy Awards so far, predictly gonna be hard competing with Swifts ""Evermore"" due they both have a huge alternative/folk touch.",Positive
471,ktoverthe,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"Lana siempre nos sorprende con sus letras tan profundas y pensadas que te hacen sentir que eres el protagonista de la canción. Este albúm se encuentra en la línea de Norma F. Rockwell, pero mucho sentimental y sumergente. Es imposible no querer repetir una y otra vez. Como siempre Del Rey nos ha demostrado que junto a Jack Antonoff, posiblemente uno de los mejores productores contemporáneos, hacen un increíble equipo y no se cansan de satisfacer al fandom con sus obras maestras.",Positive

495,hercio,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"Between whispers, she's describing the nostalgia that she's found herself submerged in. Looking back at a peaceful, but also hopeful, time, now being a name that digs deeper in these generations, Lana sings for herself too. In the Mojo interview she said she doesn't need to find a new sound, bring something that is fresh new, she only can deliver her truth, which I think is pretty honest and genuine. Some people might like it, some people don't. Lana likes it, I think that's enough for her. I lover her music so much, this is just another album I'll play every friday night.",Positive

Lana Del Rey shows her magnificent story-telling in this amazing album. Definitely, one of her best albums yet, which, to be honest, suprised me considering that NFR! could have been her peak. She continues to raise the bar for story-telling, folk and the alternative genre. Congratulations.",Positive

520,adriians,"Mar 19, 2021",9,"<span>Lana's new record, in my opinion, is watered down NFR! which isn't bad. Each track is different in its own way, and still has that signature Lana + Jack sound.</span>",Positive

524,joadsuarez,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"If there’s one thing Lana Del Rey does, and does it really well, is putting together an album. Following her monumental 2019 Album of The Year, Norman **** Rockwell, Lana is back and she’s cooler than ever, no I mean seriously, did you hear the bridge to Dance Till We Die? exactly. Lana opens up the album with White Dress, a beautiful piano ballad filled with melancholy and nostalgic lyrics where she seems to be reminiscing on her Lizzy Grant era and her pre-fame status. The Album continues to deliver with gems, like Tulsa Jesus Freak, Dark But Just A Game, and Yosemite. She Wraps it Up with a Joni Mitchell cover to For Free, Featuring Zella Day, and Weyes Blood. Chemtrails is a short album overall, but packed with great melodies and lyricism. Lana never disappoints and she’s deserving of all accolades.",Positive

This is a same old Lana telling stories to her listeners and it delivers with a clear and raw especially in the White Dress.

Chemtrails é lindo, sofisticado, melancólico e encantador, mas perde por não ser inovador no quesito ""Lana Del Rey"", podendo se confirmar assim que mesmo sendo um bom álbum, ele não será icônico como o ""Born To Die"", memorável como ""Ultravaiolence"" e nem grandioso como o ""Norman **** Rockwell"".

She flirts with the idea of leaving behind the fame; even admitting she’d be better off in a simple life as she recalls her early life in the album opener “White Dress”. This production is beautiful and done well by Jack Antonoff. The best is yet to come. Lana has done it again. 10/10,Positive

706,ramirocastro_,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"It’s one of her most mature works. Having done one of the best albums of 2019, “Norman Fu***** Rockwell!”, Del Rey goes back to her folk beginnings and gives us a beautiful work in which she mixes the former sounds with a delightful and moving lyric: nostalgia, wildness and personal freedom are some of its topics. In addition, she takes inspiration from singers such as Fiona Apple in “Dance Till We Die”. Moreover, she produced a beautiful collaboration with singers Zella Day and Weyes Blood (“For Free”) apart from having invited Nikki Lane to sing “Breaking Up Slowly”. The collaborators’ voices just cope with Lana’s voice perfectly.All in all, in terms of lyricism and production, it’s a marvellous long production – Del Rey found out the way to make one of the best albums of 2021 yet.",Positive
707,bluesparkler,"Mar 19, 2021",10,<span>Probably Lana’s best album in her whole career. Chemtrails Over The Country Club is just a cultural reset... Best track is Tulsa Jesus Freak</span>,Positive
708,ThiagoRangel,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"The ""Chemtrails Over The Country Club"" is like a passage about modern culture, about being free to be wild and vulnerable, it is about remembering good times, and like a cry in the dark, it needs to be heard and it wants to be heard. Lana Del Rey returns to her origins as Lizzy Grant (May Jailer), embodying the folk genre of her first musical project ""Sirens"" on this album.  Yosemite is one of the great highlights of the album, when she starts singing about the seasons in a poetic way, a flash back in our heads, the music and about comfort and how good it is to have a comfortable, safe, free, free love, funny. Chemtrails Over The Country Club is one of the highlights of this year, with it Elizabeth Woolridge Grant proves that she is not only the queen of New York but the queen of the world.",Positive

A mix between 'Norman **** Rockwell', 'Lust For Life' and 'Honeymoon', also a little bit of her Lizzy Grant era. 'Chemtrials Over The Country Club' talks about her life experiences, her youth and her feelings in a way you can totally reflect yourself. The music is just great, a rollercoaster of feelings produced by Jack Antonoff, and the lyrics composed by our beloved Lana Del Rey. I highly recommend this masterpiece, listen to it as soon as possible.",Positive

744,TheMusicExpert,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"Chemtrails cannot feel like a subtle but at a different point continuation of its predecessor `Norman Fkn Rockwell´ (2019), its most acclaimed album to date and it shows when listening to the first song ´White Dress´, the which goes to demonstrate another type of vocal use of Lana that we had not heard completely in her previous discography. Regarding the 11 songs on the album, we must also highlight the beautiful arrangement of the song ´Wild Heart´, in it the voices and harmonies evoke a more mature and confident Lana in her style. In addition, another of the surprises that this album gave me was the interesting production of the song ´Dark But Just a Game´ in which for seconds we are facing a well-achieved attempt of alternative Folk combined with a progressive R&B, to then start with a vocal clarity and Beattles-style production, a tonality never seen before with Lana and that is appreciated. I have always liked being very objective with this artist, when I don't like a Lana's album, I comment on it. However, in this album Lana demonstrates once again that her melodies, lyrics and style is unique and different from everything that is in the music industry today in a mature, bold and beautiful way. My Favorites: Dark But Just a Game, Yosemite, Dance Till We Die, Wild a Heart, White Dress. My least favorites: Let Me Love You Like a Women.",Positive

Just bright summer days with picnics in the grass, and quiet summer nights by a bonfire on the beach. I will always be nostalgic for Lana’s previous albums since I listened to them as a teenager, but this new sound is the start of something great. White Dress, Chemtrails Over the Country Club, Dark But Just a Game, and Not All Who Wander Are Lost are stellar tracks. So much of today’s music that is popular is louder and fast paced, and may deter some from giving this a listen because it isn’t exciting or danceable enough. However I hope that people, even Lana fans who love her old music more, give this a good listen more than once. There’s so much to appreciate from it, and I hope to see more music videos as a visual aide to this wonderful new sound of hers.",Positive

775,lluciano,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"Lana Del Rey entrega aos seus fãs e ao mundo inteiro um álbum novo com grande excelência! Antes se tinha dúvidas sobre o que estava por vir após o clássico ""NFR!', e ""aí veio ""Chemtrails Over The Country Club"", mostrando a evolução da cantora e de seus vocais, fazendo algo novo e encaminhando para algo maior ainda.Top 5 melhores: Yosemite; Not All Who Wander Are Lost; Dark But Just A Game; Tulsa Jesus Freak e Breaking Up Slowly.",Positive
776,JeanPierreAlves,"Mar 19, 2021",10,"Após o lançamento do Norman **** Rockwell!, ápice lírico e sonoro de Lana Del Rey, era difícil definir qual a expectativa que se tinha acerca do seu sucessor. A verdade é que Chemtrails Over The Country Club veio melhor do que a encomenda. Se NFR entregou coesão em uma experiência mais imersiva, seu irmão mais novo é mais contido e diverso, beirando o experimental, mas não deixando de entregar a qualidade que é característica da artista desde os seus primeiros trabalhos. Musicalmente, hoje, nenhum outro artista em evidência soa parecido à Lana Del Rey, apesar da influência da artista em variados gêneros, principalmente o pop. Taylor Swift, em 2019, foi cirúrgica ao dizer que Lana foi a artista que mais influenciou a música pop da década de 2010. E isso não muda agora. Ao explorar sonoridades diversas, passeando por batidas de jazz e acordes de country, Lana mostra mais uma vez os caminhos possíveis. O piano de White Dress combinado com a voz sussurrada que relembra os dias antes da fama entrega uma abertura tão memorável quanto a de Norman **** Rockwell. Tulsa Jesus Freak e Dark But Just A Game trazem elementos rítmicos modernos, enquanto Yosemite é um clássico acústico de Lana Del Rey. Chemtrails Over The Country Club é provavelmente um pouco mais triste e melancólico do que foi NFR, e faixas como Breaking Up Slowly são a prova disso, mas a grata surpresa da segunda parte de Dance Till We Die quebra essa atmosfera por alguns instantes, e não de uma forma negativa. Da mesma forma, a melancolia evolui para o épico na icônica Wild At Heart, uma faixa que poderia estar em qualquer outro disco da artista, mas escolheu este como abrigo e agrega muito ao conjunto. Dentre tantos acertos, a música que dá nome ao álbum, Chemtrails Over The Country Club é a faixa mais autêntica de todas, e após a gran apertura de White Dress, dá o tom para o que está por vir. É difícil superar o que Norman **** Rocwell! fez em 2019, mas aqui não há essa intenção. Há a clareza de que se é o sucessor do mesmo, e para dar certo, teria de ser diferente. Chemtrails Over The Country Club é perfeitamente diferente de seu antecessor, e nos deixa curiosos pelo que Lana Del Rey ainda poderá fazer na longa trajetória artística que tem pela frente.",Positive

846,Archellarchell,"Mar 20, 2021",10,"The best one so far! Didn’t expect she’ll go full on folk-country style & it works perfectly for her voice to be honest. “White Dress” as an opening track is a good choice, when first time listening, it felt odd especially in the chorus part but as it goes I got familiar with it and love it ever since — Overall it talks about fame, on her teenage days, working hard then getting into the music scene which she reminisces and wanting to go back, even though it’s not my story to tell, it is nostalgic at last. The vocals on “Let Me Love You Like A Woman” & “Tulsa Jesus Freak” are beyond amazing! There are production where it kind of reminiscent with her previous works such as “Wild At Heart” & “Yosemite” but they are improved versions—much profound. Though NFR! is still the best, chemtrails is much more exceptional and more personal.",Positive

Throughout the Album you can hear songs from different genres, with different styles, while you may not like a few of them, you for sure will love other songs to heaven. Since some songs like ""White Dress"" are to experimental for MY taste I need to take some points there.But no matter a contender for Album of the Year at the next Grammy Awards so far, predictly gonna be hard competing with Swifts ""Evermore"" due they both have a huge alternative/folk touch.",Positive
